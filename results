The use of an extra proccess on the test system shaves off about 1/3 of the time. this is not very noticable on small scales but the ~10 second difference for the 1000 iterations. If you are attempting to run a program on massive scale with thousands or millions of iterations. There is a potential limit with the speed of the print statments thought.
